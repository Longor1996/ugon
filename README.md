# UGON

A **object-notation** / data-format / binary-encoding that uses **gaps** in the **UTF-8 encoding**
as tags for schemaless data: **Utf-8 Gap-based Object Notation** â†’ ***UGON***!

> This repository contains the in-development version of the UGON specification and implementation.

```txt
Creation Date:  2022-07-29
Format Name:    UTF-8 Gap-based Object Notation (UGON)
Format Type:    Data Interchange / Serialization Format
Format Ext.:    .ugon
Format MIME:    application/ugon
Magic Bytes:    TBD
Specification:  https://github.com/Longor1996/ugon/SPEC.md
Implementation: https://github.com/Longor1996/ugon (Rust)
```

## Quickstart

**TODO:** Publish to https://crates.io/ once stable enough.

**TODO:** Use GitHub Actions to render the spec to HTML for GitHub Pages.

**TODO:** Use GitHub Actions for pre-built tool artefacts.

## Objectives

**TODO:** Outline general objectives. (Roadmap?)

The objectives (/goals) of this format are as follows:

- **Be self-describing / schemaless:**  
  Blobs of ugon-encoded data can *always* be read by any spec-compliant decoder,
  regardless by what application originally produced the data.  
  What the data actually *is*, is, of course, application-defined.
- **Decoding is *straight-forward* and *fast*:**  
  A decoder should only need one byte of look-ahead (i.e.: `.peek()`)
  to know what, and for continuous data, how much, to read next.
- **Compact data representation:**  
  Primitive values/arrays can be (mem-)copied as-is,
  often occurring values are folded into tags,
  and dynamic structures take as few bytes as reasonable.

## Roadmap

The highest level of tasks to be done for 1.0.0 to be reached.

- [ ] Finish the first draft of the specification.
- [ ] Implement the decoder according to the spec.
- [ ] Implement the encoder according to the spec.
- [ ] Implement the [serde](https://serde.rs/) feature.
- [ ] First release & publishing to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
- [ ] Make the library compatible with WASM.
- [ ] Create a GitHub-pages site having...
  - [ ] ...a rendered version of the current spec.
  - [ ] ...a usable JSON-to-UGON converter.
  - [ ] ...a web-viewer for UGON files.
- [ ] Create a command-line application that...
  - [ ] ...can convert JSON to UGON.
  - [ ] ...can convert UGON to JSON.
  - [ ] ...can print a tree-view of a given UGON file.
  - [ ] ...can return subsets of a given UGON file via 'path' semantics.
- [ ] Create a visual editor for UGON files.
  - Almost certainly using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## How and why?

**TODO:** Explain why (ref: https://xkcd.com/927/).

**TODO:** Explain how UTF-8 gap encoding works and why it's safe.

**TODO:** Explain the various types of tags.
